        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> SDG 7 is a crucial component of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aiming to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services by 2030. This goal recognizes the essential role of energy in promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and improving living standards.

Energy is a fundamental human need, necessary for cooking, heating, lighting, transportation, and powering essential services like healthcare and education. However, billions of people worldwide still lack access to modern energy sources, relying on traditional fuels like wood, charcoal, and kerosene, which are often inefficient, polluting, and dangerous.

        <section id="goals">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The specific targets under SDG 7 include ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services for all, increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, improving energy efficiency in all sectors, expanding international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy technology and finance, ensuring that all countries have the capacity to plan and implement comprehensive energy policies, and promoting sustainable energy infrastructure and technology. These targets aim to address the critical challenges of energy poverty, climate change, and environmental degradation, and to ensure that everyone has access to the basic human right to affordable and clean energy.
 </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> High upfront costs of investing in renewable energy infrastructure, technological limitations of renewable energy technologies, infrastructure challenges in building and maintaining a modern energy infrastructure, policy barriers hindering the development and adoption of renewable energy technologies, access to finance for developing countries, geopolitical factors disrupting energy supply chains and limiting access to energy resources, and social and cultural factors hindering the adoption of renewable energy technologies. These challenges can make it difficult for countries to transition away from fossil fuels and ensure that everyone has access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services.

        </section>

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>Investing in renewable energy infrastructure through subsidies, tax incentives, and other financial mechanisms. Improving energy efficiency in buildings, industries, and transportation to reduce energy consumption and lower costs. Expanding access to clean energy by investing in grid infrastructure and off-grid solutions. Promoting international cooperation to share knowledge, technology, and resources for accelerating the transition to clean energy. Addressing policy barriers by creating a supportive policy environment for renewable energy, including clear regulations, incentives, and grid integration standards. Mobilizing finance to increase the availability of financing for clean energy projects. Building capacity in the energy sector through technical skills, policy expertise, and institutional capabilities. Addressing social and cultural factors hindering the adoption of renewable energy technologies.

By implementing these solutions, governments, businesses, and individuals can contribute to achieving SDG 7 and building a more sustainable and equitable energy future.</p>
