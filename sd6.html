        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) is part of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Water is essential for life and plays a critical role in human health, agriculture, and industry. Despite its importance, many regions face severe water scarcity and inadequate sanitation facilities, leading to significant health and economic impacts.

SDG 6 has several key targets, including achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, improving water quality by reducing pollution, increasing water-use efficiency, and implementing integrated water resources management. The goal also emphasizes the need for international cooperation to support water and sanitation activities in developing countries.

Addressing SDG 6 is crucial for the health and well-being of people around the world and for the sustainability of ecosystems and economies.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This goal encompasses several key objectives: ensuring universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, improving water quality by reducing pollution, and increasing water-use efficiency across all sectors to promote sustainable water withdrawals. Additionally, it seeks to protect and restore water-related ecosystems, such as rivers, wetlands, and lakes, and to support the implementation of integrated water resources management at all levels. By addressing these targets, SDG 6 strives to secure access to clean water and sanitation, which are fundamental to human health, economic development, and environmental sustainability. </li>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 faces several significant challenges. Water scarcity affects billions of people globally, with over two billion individuals lacking access to safe drinking water. Pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and inadequate waste management contaminates water sources, leading to health risks and ecosystem degradation. In many regions, the infrastructure for water supply and sanitation is outdated or insufficient, exacerbating access issues. Climate change further complicates these problems by altering precipitation patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, which can impact water availability and quality. Additionally, rapid urbanization and population growth place increased pressure on existing water resources and sanitation systems, making it harder to ensure equitable access and manage resources sustainably. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts, innovative solutions, and substantial investments in water infrastructure and management.</p>

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>To overcome the challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 6, a comprehensive approach is required. Investing in infrastructure is crucial for upgrading water supply and sanitation systems, ensuring access to clean water and effective waste management. Addressing pollution involves implementing stricter regulations and improving waste treatment processes to protect water quality. Promoting water efficiency through technologies and practices in agriculture, industry, and households can help reduce water waste. Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems is essential for maintaining natural water cycles and enhancing water quality. Integrated water resources management (IWRM) is key for coordinating the development and use of water resources to balance economic, social, and environmental needs. Raising awareness about water conservation and hygiene practices can drive more sustainable behaviors. Finally, international cooperation is vital for sharing resources, technology, and financial support, particularly for developing countries facing significant water challenges. These combined efforts are essential for making progress toward ensuring sustainable water and sanitation access for all.</p>
