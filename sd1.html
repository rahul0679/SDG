        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Goal 1 (SDG 1) is centered on ending poverty in all its forms everywhere. It is the first of the 17 global goals set by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Poverty remains one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity, with millions of people worldwide struggling to meet basic needs like food, shelter, and access to essential services.

SDG 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day, and to reduce the proportion of people living in poverty in all its dimensions by half. Achieving this goal requires a multifaceted approach, addressing not only income poverty but also access to resources, social protection systems, and opportunities for sustainable livelihoods. Efforts to meet SDG 1 are closely linked to other goals, such as ensuring quality education (SDG 4), promoting decent work (SDG 8), and reducing inequalities (SDG 10).

By focusing on SDG 1, the global community acknowledges that eliminating poverty is crucial for creating a more just, equitable, and sustainable world for all.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> The goals of SDG 1, "No Poverty," focus on eradicating extreme poverty, reducing poverty in all its forms, implementing social protection systems, and ensuring equal access to resources and services by 2030. These objectives aim to halve the number of people living in poverty, provide substantial coverage through social protection, and guarantee equal rights to economic resources, such as land, technology, and financial services, particularly for the poor and vulnerable. Together, these targets are designed to create a more just and equitable world, leaving no one behind.</li>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> Achieving SDG 1, "No Poverty," faces several challenges that hinder progress. Economic inequality remains a major obstacle, as the widening gap between rich and poor limits access to resources, education, and opportunities for those living in poverty. Additionally, many people lack access to quality education and healthcare, which are critical for breaking the cycle of poverty but remain out of reach for millions, particularly in developing regions. Insufficient social protection systems also pose a significant challenge, leaving vulnerable populations exposed to economic shocks, illness, and unemployment without a safety net. Furthermore, climate change exacerbates poverty by disproportionately affecting those in vulnerable communities, who are more susceptible to natural disasters, food insecurity, and environmental degradation. These interconnected challenges require comprehensive, coordinated efforts to effectively address poverty in all its dimensions.

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p> Addressing SDG 1, "No Poverty," involves implementing multifaceted solutions that tackle the root causes of poverty. To address economic inequality, policies must promote inclusive growth through progressive taxation, fair wages, and job creation that offers sustainable livelihoods. Ensuring access to quality education and healthcare is crucial; investments in these sectors can empower individuals and break the cycle of poverty. Expanding and strengthening social protection systems, including safety nets and unemployment benefits, can shield vulnerable populations from economic shocks and uncertainties. Additionally, tackling climate change through sustainable practices and climate adaptation strategies is essential, as it helps mitigate the impact on poor communities who are disproportionately affected by environmental challenges. By combining these approaches, it is possible to create a more equitable and resilient society where poverty can be effectively reduced and ultimately eradicated.
