        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> SDG 10 aims to reduce inequality within and among countries. It recognizes that inequality is a persistent and pervasive challenge that can hinder economic growth, social progress, and sustainable development. The goal seeks to promote social justice, inclusion, and equality of opportunity for all. This includes addressing inequalities in income, wealth, education, health, and other areas of life. By reducing inequality, countries can create more just and equitable societies, promote social cohesion, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

        <section id="goals">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The specific targets under SDG 10 include: reducing income inequality within and among countries; promoting social mobility and inclusion of marginalized groups; ensuring equal access to education, healthcare, and other basic services; protecting the rights of vulnerable groups, including women, children, and people with disabilities; enhancing the participation of developing countries in the global economy; promoting policies that promote income redistribution and social justice; promoting policies that reduce inequalities in access to essential services; promoting policies that reduce inequalities in income and wealth; promoting policies that reduce inequalities in education and health; and promoting policies that reduce inequalities in access to opportunities. These targets aim to address the root causes of inequality and create more just and equitable societies.

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> Persistent income inequality, social exclusion and discrimination, limited access to education and healthcare, weak governance and institutions, global economic challenges, social and cultural factors perpetuating inequality, lack of data and evidence, and the need for enhanced international cooperation. These challenges can make it difficult to achieve SDG 10 and create more just and equitable societies. For example, in many countries, a small minority of people hold a disproportionate share of wealth, while the majority struggle to meet their basic needs. Additionally, marginalized groups, such as women, children, and people with disabilities, often face discrimination and exclusion, limiting their access to opportunities and resources. These challenges are further exacerbated by global economic trends, such as globalization and technological change, which can lead to job losses and income inequality.

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>Promoting progressive taxation and social protection, investing in education and healthcare, promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, addressing discrimination and social exclusion, strengthening governance and institutions, promoting international cooperation, collecting and analyzing data, and promoting sustainable development. By implementing these solutions, countries can make progress towards reducing inequality and creating more just and equitableÂ societies.</p>
