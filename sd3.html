        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) is part of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its primary focus is on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all people at all ages. The goal aims to reduce the global maternal mortality rate, end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, reduce road injuries and deaths, and achieve universal health coverage, among other targets. SDG 3 highlights the importance of universal health coverage, access to quality essential health services, and access to essential medicines and vaccines.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all individuals at every stage of life. Key targets include reducing maternal and child mortality rates, ending epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and combating mental health issues. The goal emphasizes the need for universal health coverage, which includes access to essential health services and quality medicines and vaccines. Additionally, it seeks to reduce road injuries and deaths, address health challenges related to pollution and hazardous chemicals, and strengthen health systems to improve overall health outcomes globally.</li>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> SDG 3 encounters several significant challenges. Health inequities remain a major issue, with disparities in access to healthcare and outcomes between different regions and socio-economic groups. The threat of pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19, can overwhelm health systems and hinder progress. Many people still lack access to essential health services, medications, and vaccines, particularly in remote or underserved areas. Additionally, weak health infrastructure, insufficient funding, and shortages of trained health professionals undermine the effectiveness of health services. The rise of non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires substantial investment in prevention and treatment. Environmental factors like pollution and climate change also negatively impact health, complicating efforts to achieve overall well-being. Addressing these challenges demands a coordinated global effort and substantial investment in health systems and equitable policies.

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>Addressing the challenges of SDG 3 requires a multifaceted approach. Strengthening health systems is crucial, including increasing investment in healthcare infrastructure, expanding access to essential health services, and ensuring a trained workforce is available. Enhancing universal health coverage can help address disparities and improve access to necessary medications and vaccines. Tackling non-communicable diseases involves implementing comprehensive prevention and treatment strategies and promoting healthier lifestyles. Global cooperation is essential for managing pandemics and epidemics, including improving surveillance and response systems. Additionally, addressing environmental factors like pollution and climate change through sustainable practices can help mitigate their impact on health. Fostering equity and ensuring that health initiatives reach the most vulnerable populations are also key to achieving these goals.
