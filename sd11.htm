            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>SDG 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Urban areas are growing rapidly, and focusing on sustainable development is essential for improving the quality of life for all residents.
Due to their high concentration of people, infrastructures, housing and economic activities, cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters impacts. Building urban resilience is crucial to avoid human, social and economic losses while improving the sustainability of urbanization processes is needed to protect the environment and mitigate disaster risk and climate change.
Resource efficient cities combine greater productivity and innovation with lower costs and reduced environmental impacts, while providing increased opportunities for consumer choices and sustainable lifestyles.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure access to safe and affordable housing.</li>
                <li>Provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems.</li>
                <li>Upgrade slum settlements.</li>
                <li>Support positive economic, social, and environmental links between urban, per-urban, and rural areas.</li>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Urban areas face challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, pollution, and insufficient public services.
 Addressing these issues requires comprehensive urban planning and sustainable development strategies.
Cities are crucial for addressing the sustainability challenges of the 21st century. They are home to more than half of the world's population and account for more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cities are also where different crises manifest and converge: poverty, inequality, pollution, congestion, and vulnerability to disasters as well as infrastructure deterioration due to climate change pressures. Despite these pathologies, cities are also the spaces where transformative solutions and innovations are emerging, co-created and tested. As places of conflict and opportunity, urban areas are under pressure to achieve sustainability as it is essential for the well-being of people and the planet.

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>Implementing green technologies, improving public transportation, and promoting inclusive urban planning are key solutions to achieving SDG 11. Cities need to integrate sustainability into their development plans to enhance livability and resilience.
To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 11, cities must focus on creating inclusive, safe, and resilient urban environments. This involves promoting affordable housing through inclusive policies and innovative models, investing in sustainable urban planning that incorporates smart technologies and green spaces, and enhancing public transportation while encouraging non-motorized transport. Resilient infrastructure and disaster preparedness are crucial for coping with climate change, alongside effective waste management and pollution control to ensure clean air and water. Energy efficiency can be improved through stringent building codes and renewable energy investments. Additionally, enhancing safety and security, fostering participatory governance, supporting local economic development, and ensuring access to healthcare are essential for improving urban quality of life. By addressing these interconnected areas, cities can become more sustainable and better equipped to meet the needs of all residents.
